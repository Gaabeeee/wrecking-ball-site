    <h1>The Lore of Wrecking Ball</h1>
    <p>
        Wrecking Ball, also known as Hammond, is a genetically enhanced hamster and a brilliant mechanical engineer who escaped the Horizon Lunar Colony during a major uprising. Originally one of the many animal test subjects aboard the colony, Hammond was part of experiments to increase animal intelligence. While Winston, the famous gorilla scientist, chose to return to Earth for heroism, Hammond had other plans—plans that involved chaos and cleverness.

    <h2>Escape from the Moon</h2>
    <p>
        During the lunar uprising, Hammond covertly modified an escape pod and tethered it to Winston’s departing spacecraft. The pod eventually detached during re-entry, crash-landing in the wastelands of Australia known as the Outback. There, he found himself in a brutal and lawless area dominated by scavengers and mechanical gladiators.
    </p>

    <h2>Welcome to Junkertown</h2>
    <p>
        Junkertown is a fortified scrap city built from the ruins of a destroyed Omnium. It is ruled by the Junker Queen and thrives on combat, salvage, and competition. In this harsh environment, Hammond modified his drop pod using the scavenged parts and machinery scattered across the wasteland. These upgrades gave rise to his spherical mech—equipped with quad cannons, a grappling claw, and an adaptive shield—transforming him into the combatant known as Wrecking Ball.
    </p>

    <h2>Champion of the Arena</h2>
    <p>
        In Junkertown’s mech combat arena, Hammond quickly rose through the ranks. Known only as “Wrecking Ball,” he became a crowd favorite, dominating fight after fight with unmatched agility and firepower. The crowd never suspected that the pilot inside the menacing mech was actually a small, intelligent hamster.

    <h2>Unpredictable Genius</h2>
    <p>
        Despite his cute appearance, Hammond is a genius. He continually improves his mech and adapts to any challenge. His lack of spoken language is compensated for through mechanical voice lines and emotes. Unpredictable and independent, Hammond now roams the world with his custom-built mech, driven by curiosity, competition, and a love for mechanical innovation.
